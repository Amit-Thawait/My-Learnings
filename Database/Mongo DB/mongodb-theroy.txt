Mongo DB :-
-----------
sudo apt-get install mongodb


The MongoDB Ruby driver is the 10gen-supported driver for MongoDB. It's written in pure Ruby, with a recommended C extension for speed. The driver is optimized for simplicity. It can be used on its own, but it also serves as the basis of several object mapping libraries, such as MongoMapper.

 - Install mondo-ruby-driver

For significantly improved performance, install the bson_ext gem. Using compiled C instead of Ruby, this gem speeds up BSON serialization greatly.

 - gem install bson_ext
 
Object Mappers :-

Because MongoDB is so easy to use, the basic Ruby driver can be the best solution for many applications.

But if you need validations, associations, and other high-level data modeling functions then an Object Document Mapper may be needed.

In the context of a Rails application these provide functionality equivalent to, but distinct from, ActiveRecord. Because Mongo is a document-based database, these mappers are called Object Document Mappers (ODM) as opposed to Object Relational Mappers (ORM).

Several mappers are available:

      MongoMapper from John Nunemaker
      Mongoid from Durran Jordan
      Mongomatic from Ben Myles
      MongoODM from Carlos Paramio
      MongoModel from Sam Pohlenz
      DriverAPILayer from Alexey Petrushin

All the mappers build on top of the basic Ruby driver and so some knowledge of that is useful, especially if you work with a custom Mongo configuration.
