How to get email ID from twitter oauth API?

This is now possible by filling out a form to request elevated permissions(https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/account/verify_credentials):

Go to https://support.twitter.com/forms/platform
Select "I need access to special permissions"
Enter Application Name and ID. These can be obtained via https://apps.twitter.com/ -- the application ID is the numeric part in the browser's address bar after you click your app.
Permissions Request: "Email address"
Submit & wait for response
