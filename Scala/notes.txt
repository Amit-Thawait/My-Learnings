Int is a member of package scala, "Int" is the class's simple name, and "scala.Int" is its full name

Scala has two kinds of variables, val s and var s. A val is similar to a final variable in Java. Once initialized, a val can never be reassigned.
A var, by contrast, is similar to a non-final variable in Java. A var can be reassigned throughout its lifetime.

Function definitions start with def. The function's name, in this case max, is followed by a comma-separated list of parameters in parentheses.
A type annotation must follow every function parameter, preceded by a colon, because the Scala compiler does not infer function parameter types.
scala> def max(x: Int, y: Int): Int = {
     | if (x > y) x
     | else y
     | }
max: (x: Int, y: Int)Int

scala> max(5, 8)
res12: Int = 8

In Java, the type of the value returned from a method is its return type. In Scala, that same concept is called result type.
