Database key-points :-
======================
1) Order of execution for SQL clauses :
   FROM
   WHERE
   GROUPBY
   HAVING
   SELECT
   ORDERBY

2) Long datatype cannot be used for primary key column.(oracle)

3) Order of check of column constraint :
   NOT NULL
   CHECK
   PRIMARY KEY
   FOREIGN KEY

4) ALTER TABLE EMP
     ADD CONSTRAINT CK_SAL_EMP CHECK (SAL > 3000) NOVALIDATE;
   NOVALIDATE is used to not validate the existing records while adding the constraint on the existing table.
   It will validate the future records.
   NOVALIDATE can only be applied to CHECK constraint and not primary key & foreign key.

5) ALTER TABLE EMP
     MODIFY(ENAME NOT NULL);
   To change column from accepting NULL values to not NULL values use modify command. 
   From now on Null values will not be accepted in the EMP table.

6) CONSTRAINTS affects the performance while insertion.

7) Use of functions in SELECT statement takes more time, so if possible try to use some operator otherwise function.
   SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE LENGTH(ENAME) = 5;
   can also be written as
   SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE NAME = "_ _ _ _ _";

8) Multi-row functions (that acts on multiple rows) are called as group functions or aggregate functions.
   SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP;
   SELECT MAX(SAL, COMM) FROM EMP; ==> x (Not Allowed)

9) COUNT function only counts not null values. NULL values are not counted.
