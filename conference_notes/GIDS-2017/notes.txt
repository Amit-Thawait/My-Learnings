2) BuildingIntellegent Apps - @rajdeepdua from salesforce
* Data related to AI (Mobility devices & IOT devices) cannot fit in an RDBMS
- Einstine (ML as a service) , Watson AI services

3) Build what's next
* Pokemon-Go - Largest ever deployment of Kubernetes in Google Cloud
  1X - 5X (their estimated worst case) - 50X (actual load they experienced)

4) Cloud Architectural Design Patterns Blueprints
* Microsoft threat modelling

* No hardcoded end-points
- Manage via zookeeper

* Marathon-Mesos

* API management through Proxy

* The twelve factor (https://12factor.net/)

4) Practical examples of Serverless Architecture - Scott Davis
* AWS, GCE, RackSpace are IaaS
  AWS BeanStalk, Google AppEngine, Heroku, OpenShift are PaaS
  Lambda, Google cloud function, Apache OpenWhisk are FaaS

  Function === Taking a can instead of renting a car.

* Apache OpenWhisk is OSS currently works with IBM Bluemix but will be configurable to use any of FaaS.

5) Pro Docker by Ken Sipe
* docker ps -lq
  l stand for last and q stand for running processes

* docker diff <container_id>
  to see the diff between current state and last command

6) Understanding the No in NoSQL : Venkat Subramaniam
* Earlier data for OOP were saved in OODBMS
  OODBMS didn't had a query language

* RDBMS killed OODBMS

* Distributed RDBMS is pricy

* NoSQL is mainly "no Schema"

* Two kinds of NoSQL :
i) Aggregate Oriented
  - Focused on parent(key) and child(value)
    Ex: Key-value pairs, user preferences, session data can be stored.
ii) Aggregate Ignorant
  - Focused on relationships of data
    Ex: Graph DB

* 90% of NoSQL are Aggregate Oriented

* Aggregate Oriented DB
- Key-value
- Document based (Nested key-value) (logging, blogs, CMS)
- Column family DB
- Clustered based on the aggregate
  Ex: Bucketing the data (Easy to navigate). Alphabetically like (names from A-L in one bucket, M-P in another, Q-Z in another)
- Hard to perform ad-hoc queries (will have to visit each related node)
- Provides ACID only on aggregate

* Aggregate Ignorant
- Graph DB
  Focused on relationships
  Easy to add/remove relationships
  Easy to query
  Ex: Social networking data, relationships

* Impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously follow all these three :
i) Consistency
ii) Availability
iii) Partition tolerance
So a balance has to made to achieve this. This is called eventual consistency.

Day 2:
======

1) Evolutionary Architecture by Neal Ford
* The world is moving very fast
  What you design for next 5 years will become obselete.
  Ex: Docker

* Layered Architecture
  - Presentation Layer |
    Business Layer     | -> All are associated with customer checkout functionality
    Persistance Layer  |
    Database Layer     |

* Evolutionary architecture should expand to atleast 1 dimension (layer)

* Netflix taught us to monitor not only the features but the paths as well.
  If the path is not touched - eliminate that feature.

* Book - Refactoring Database : Evolutionary Database Design (By - Scott W. Ambler and Pramod J. Sadalage)

* Microservices === DDD + Continuous Delivery
  DDD ex: customer checkout feature

* Netflix tool - Choas Monkey - OSS
  To test resiliency use Choas Monkey
  If one DC like US-east-1 is down - replicate completely

* For defining architecture :
  Try to write tests and run them whenever there is a change in the architecture

* Books
- Continuous Delivery
- Release IT
- Infrastructure as a code
- Refactoring Databases

* Architecture is only abstract untill it is operationalized

* In microservices : prefer duplication over coupling

* The more reusable the code is, the less usable it is - Difficult to use.

* UI          |
  Server side | -> Domain Driven Design
  DB          |    Conway's law - wiki

* Sacrificial Architecture
  Things that you will through down in future.

* Github's scientist project

* http://evolutionaryarchitecture.com/ - Upcoming book in June 2017

2) Where DevOps meets Architecture
* There is no 1 way of doing things.
  Ex: Water flowing story -> through land then sand, gets stuck then evaporates, touches hills and then flows again

3) Hypothesis Driven Development - Neal ford
* https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/

* Feature toggle : https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html

* QA in production
- Can be done using feature toggle, so that new features are only visible to QA
  via firewall settings or other techniques
- Add a story to remove feature toggle

* Don't create a toggle that depends on other toggle

* Toggle configuration
- Consul https://www.consul.io/
- Etcd https://github.com/coreos/etcd
- Zookeeper
- Parameterize in code or DB or config file

* Feature toggle framework for Rails http://balvig.github.com/chili/
- Feature toggle framework is there for every framework

* Hypothesis driven UX
- Analytics tells bigger images gives better conversion for Hotel booking
- Increase in number of features never converts customers.

* More Listing | Better Structure | Better prioritization
      X             Important               X

* Github Blog : Move fast and fix things : https://githubengineering.com/move-fast/

* Github Scientist : https://github.com/github/scientist
- In scientist there are 2 paths : "try" and "use"
- For 10% use "try" and for 90% use "use" path
- Always process request using "use", but also return diff output between "try" and "use"
- Scientist is a specialized feature toggle

* Hypothesis Driven Development
  (Production)----->(Test in Lab)
        ^                |
        |                |
        |                |
  (Fix Things)<----------

* For Microservices : build two microservices and use routing to divert

* Feature Toggle requires discipline by the developer to not overdo it

* Sometimes routing is better than feature toggle

4) Core Software Design Principles - Venkat Subramaniam
* YAGNI
- Develop only what is required today
- You will be smarter tomorrow, there will be new tools tomorrow

* Which method is long?
- It is not decided by the number of lines
- It depends on the level of abstraction (unit of work)
- SLAP (single level of abstraction principle)

* Liskov Substitution Principle
- Use inheritance only for substitutability
  If an object of a class B should be used anywhere an object of a class A may be used, then use inheritance
- If an object of a class B may use an object of class A, then use delegation

* To avoid duplication, if you use inheritance then it is bad. Use delegation.
- Delegate method in Ruby

* Dependency Inversion Principle
- It should depend upon abstraction rather than concretion
  Ex: Alarm example
  Human, TV, Clock -> Alarm

5) Continuous Delivery for Architects - Neal ford
* Yesterday's best practice may become antipattern tomorrow

* http://structure101.com/ For Java ecosystem to see class dependency

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing
- The network is reliable.
- Latency is zero.
- Bandwidth is infinite.
- The network is secure.
- Topology doesn't change.
- There is one administrator.
- Transport cost is zero.
- The network is homogeneous.

* Types of Microservices :
i) Microservices
ii) SOA (Service oriented applications)
iii) Service based applications

* Service oriented applications
  Business
      |
  Message Bus
      |
  Enterprise services
      |                       |
  Application Services -> Infrastructure services

* Service oriented applications and service based applications
  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzy6PCmldaXIYW5UWGlCRFFEQWM/view?usp=sharing

* Microservices shouldn't always be tiny. It should have proper bounded context. Some microservices are pretty large.

6) 12 ways to make code suck less - Venkat Subramaniam
* Simple Design
i) Passes the test    ^
ii) Reveals intention |
iii) No Duplication   | Priority order
iv) Fewer elements    |

* Avoid primitive obsession
- Use methods provided by the language

* Prefer clean code over clever code

* General Book : On Writing Well
- http://www.amazon.in/Writing-Wel-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548/

* Reduce state & state mutation
- State cannot be eliminated, try to reduce it

7) HTTP/2 - Scott Davis
* HTTP/2 and SPDY indicator - chrome extension

* OPTIONS verb tells what verbs webserver supports

* HEAD returns only headers

* Websockets are persistant durable connections
- No standard verbs in websockets
- SOAP only allows POST requests
- What SOAP to REST is, websockets to HTTP is.

* Websockets are secure by default
- websockets is event driven
- socket.io NodeJS library

* SPDY connections are secure out of the box

* HTTP/2 supports multiplexed connections

* QUIC : Quick UDP internet connections
- TCP requires us to acknowledge packets.
