How to get email ID from twitter oauth API?

This is now possible by filling out a form to request elevated permissions(https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/account/verify_credentials):

Go to https://support.twitter.com/forms/platform
Select "I need access to special permissions"
Enter Application Name and ID. These can be obtained via https://apps.twitter.com/ -- the application ID is the numeric part in the browser's address bar after you click your app.
Permissions Request: "Email address"
Submit & wait for response

After your request is granted, an addition permission setting is added in your twitter app's permission section.
Go to permission setting and just tick the checkbox for "Request email addresses from users"

This permission is only enabled on new sign-ins to your app.
