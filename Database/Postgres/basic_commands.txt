To use newly created database named twist_experiment :
\c twist_experiment

To List schemas inside that database
\dn

Create table accounts(
  id integer
);

To see list of relations (table is also a type of relation)
\dt
          List of relations
 Schema |   Name   | Type  |  Owner   
--------+----------+-------+----------
 public | accounts | table | synerzip
(1 row)

insert into accounts values (1);

By default whatever you create goes inside "public" schema

create schema alternative;

create table alternative.accounts(
  id integer
);

\dt
          List of relations
 Schema |   Name   | Type  |  Owner   
--------+----------+-------+----------
 public | accounts | table | synerzip
(1 row)

Its still showing relations from public schema because the schema search path right now is $user,public , which means that PostgreSQL will look up tables
in a schema that matches the current user's name, as well as in the "public" schema.

SET search_path = 'alternative';

\dt
             List of relations
   Schema    |   Name   | Type  |  Owner   
-------------+----------+-------+----------
 alternative | accounts | table | synerzip
(1 row)

select * from accounts;
 id 
----
(0 rows)

insert into accounts values (2);

Select * from accounts;
 id 
----
  2
(1 row)

If we were to run a query such as SELECT * FROM public.accounts at this point, it will still return the data from the accounts table within the public schema.
This is because PostgreSQL is smart enough to know we're being explicit about what schema we're querying from, meaning we don't need to edit the schema search path
to query a different schema.

Another benefit is the automatic fallback feature of schemas. If a table is missing from one schema in the search path, PostgreSQL will see if the table is
contained in any of the other schemas (in the order they're listed) and if so, it'll then query that table.

If we set the search path to use the alternative schema first, and then the public schema, we can see both of these benefits in action:
SET search_path = 'alternative', 'public';

show search_path;
     search_path     
---------------------
 alternative, public
(1 row)

select * from accounts;
 id 
----
  2
(1 row)
