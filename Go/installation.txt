Installation (Ubuntu):-
-----------------------
1) Download the source
   https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.5.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

2) Extract the source
   sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.5.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

3) Set PATH for go : Add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable
   Add the below line in $HOME/.profile
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

   OR (If you want to keep the extracted go source to some other location besides /usr/local/)

   Installing to a custom location :
   For example, if you installed Go to your home directory you should add the following commands to $HOME/.profile
   export GOROOT=$HOME/go
   export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin

   Run > . ~/.profile (To relaod the env variable)

4) Test your installation
   Create a dir where you want to keep your go programs.
   Lets say you create a dir name workspace under $HOME dir, then lets say you created a dir named go_programs.

   Now set GOPATH to the above created dir where you want to keep your go programs.
   Add the below line in $HOME/.profile
   export GOPATH=$HOME/workspace/go_programs

   > . ~/.profile (To relaod the env variable)

   Next, make the directories src/github.com/user/hello inside your workspace (if you use GitHub, substitute your user name for user), and inside the hello
   directory create a file named hello.go with the following contents:

   package main

   import "fmt"

   func main() {
       fmt.Printf("hello, world\n")
   }

   Then compile it with the go tool:
   > cd ~/workspace/go_programs/src
   > go install github.com/user/hello

   The above command will put an executable command named hello (or hello.exe) inside the bin directory of your workspace. Execute the command to see the greeting:
   > $GOPATH/bin/hello  # hello, world
   OR
   > ~/workspace/go_programs/bin/hello   # hello, world
