Failure and Recovery :
======================
In centos-master

Stop centos-minion3 node using
systemctl stop docker kubelet kube-proxy

kubectl run myrecovery --image=latest123/apache --port=80 --replicas=2 --labels=app=myrecovery

kubectl get deployments

kubectl get nodes

In centos-minion1
systemctl stop docker kubelet kube-proxy

Wait for centos-minion1 to come in NotReady state

kubectl get nodes

kubectl get pods
# Still shows 2 pods running

It will not deploy the pod in any other node besides centos-minion1 because other resource who were interacting with it earlier might not have access to the new node.

As soon as centos-minion1 is up, the containers is created by by kubectl again as part of recovery.

In centos-minion1
systemctl start docker kubelet kube-proxy

check docker ps in centos-minion1 after kubectl get nodes shows minion1 is in Ready state.

kubectl get pods
