Creating temporary pods at the command line :
=============================================
In centos-master

kubectl get pods
# No pods

In centos-minion1 & centos-minion2
# No containers should be running

kubectl run mysample --image=latest123/apache

Kubectl run command creates deployment

kubectl get pods
# Note the pod name

kubectl get deployments

kubectl describe deployments
# This doesn't tells in which minion does this pod is running

kubectl describe pod <pod_name>

kubectl delete deployment mysample
# This will delete the deployment mysample and all the pods & containers associated with it

kubectl get deployments

kubectl get pods
# If there are pods that are still shown (they may be terminating state) then wait for 10 seconds, they will get deleted.

kubectl run myreplicas --image=latest123/apache --replicas=2 --labels=app=myapache,version=1.0
# This will create 2 replicas

kubectl describe deployment myreplicas

kubectl get pods

kubectl describe pods -l version=1.0
