A Tour of Go :-
---------------
1) The imports grouped into a parenthesized, "factored" import statement.
   import (
       "fmt"
       "math"
   )

   You can also write multiple import statements, like:
   import "fmt"
   import "math"
   But it is good style to use the factored import statement.

2) In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter.
   Foo is an exported name, as is FOO. The name foo is not exported.
   Ex: fmt.Println("Hello World")
       math.Pi

3) In string interpolation
   %T => data type of variable
   %v => value of the variable
   %q => int     -> '\x00'
         float64 -> %!q(float64=0)
         boolean -> %!q(bool=false)
         string  -> ""
