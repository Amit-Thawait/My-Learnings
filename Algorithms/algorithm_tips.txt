1) Always try to relate the question with a real world example and try to solve it before thinking about anything further. (Reverse engineering)
Ex : Find all permutations of a smaller string s within a larger string b.
s = abbc
b = cbabadcbbabbcbabaabccbabc
Think about how would you have done it manully, then try to convert it into an algorithm (Keep in mind the optimizations you made manully)
