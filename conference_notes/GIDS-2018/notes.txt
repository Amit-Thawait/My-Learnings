GIDS Day 3 : DATA & Cloud
=========================

1) An Architect's guide to evaluating cloud services :
------------------------------------------------------
- Many times best of 1 + best of 2 + best of 3 (cloud service provider) = worst

- Non functional requirements is a terrible term because it doesn't matter if functional requirements are met without NFR.

- Availability         | ->
  Consistency          | -> Pick 1 among these two
  Partition tolerance  * Pick this

- Durability

- Security
  - If the system is not tolerant and not highly available then it doesn't matter how secure it is.
  - Security is not a binary thing.

- Authentication

- Authorization

- Encryption
  - Data at rest (This is alno not a binary thing)
  - Data in flight

- Certifications required
  - PCI, HIPPA .. these are also not binary

- Economics

- FAAS is costlier than dedicated servers if the number of requests is too large (when you scale)

- Scalability

- Multiple providers

2) Productionalizing ElasticSearch at scale :
---------------------------------------------
- Use bulk insert instead of single insert

- Async translog flush

- Keep higher refresh interval

- Routing
  - For a bulk insert send the bulk insert statement to single shard.
    It performs better compared to sending it to all the shards because of latency.

- Resiliency
  - Timeouts
  - Retries
  - Back pressuring incoming requests
  - Circuit breaker

- Back pressure
  -
