Database key-points :-
======================
1) Order of execution for SQL clauses :
   FROM
   WHERE
   GROUPBY
   HAVING
   SELECT
   ORDERBY

2) Long datatype cannot be used for primary key column.(oracle)

3) Order of check of column constraint :
   NOT NULL
   CHECK
   PRIMARY KEY
   FOREIGN KEY

4) ALTER TABLE EMP
     ADD CONSTRAINT CK_SAL_EMP CHECK (SAL > 3000) NOVALIDATE;
   NOVALIDATE is used to not validate the existing records while adding the constraint on the existing table.
   It will validate the future records.
   NOVALIDATE can only be applied to CHECK constraint and not primary key & foreign key.

5) ALTER TABLE EMP
     MODIFY(ENAME NOT NULL);
   To change column from accepting NULL values to not NULL values use modify command. 
   From now on Null values will not be accepted in the EMP table.

6) CONSTRAINTS affects the performance while insertion.

7) Use of functions in SELECT statement takes more time, so if possible try to use some operator otherwise function.
   SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE LENGTH(ENAME) = 5;
   can also be written as
   SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE NAME = "_ _ _ _ _";

8) Multi-row functions (that acts on multiple rows) are called as group functions or aggregate functions.
   SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP;
   SELECT MAX(SAL, COMM) FROM EMP; ==> x (Not Allowed)

9) COUNT function only counts not null values. NULL values are not counted.

10)WHERE VS HAVING :
   Both clauses are used to filter the data.
   To filter rows use WHERE clause , but to filter groups use HAVING clause.

   In condition if aggregate function is not present then use WHERE clause.
   In condition if aggregate function is present then use HAVING clause.

   WHERE clause should be used before GROUP BY & HAVING clause should be used after GROUP BY.

11)If we want to get the data from one table by referring the data from other table then it can be done by either
   subquery or join.
   But in this case subquery gives better performance.
   JOIN takes more time because both tables should be loaded in the memory and WHERE condition should be checked for
   each & every record.

   To get the data from multiple tables, use JOIN operation.

12)A VIEW doesn't contain any data, doesn't occupy any space.
   When a VIEW is created the query (SELECT empno, ename, sal FROM emp) associated with the view is stored in the DB.
   A VIEW is also called as stored query.
   Query fired using VIEW is slower compared to the same using base table.

13) A composite index on user_id and created_at, you do not need an index on user_id as the composite will cover you.
    Column order in composite indexes is important. As far as a rule of thumb, you should order by whatever will satisfy
    the most queries or when only dealing with similar queries, whatever will reduce the rows your database has to read.
    (Always use a limit when reading data)
