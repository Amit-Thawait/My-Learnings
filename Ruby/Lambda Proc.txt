Proc is a callable object in ruby and this is not executed unless called explicitly where as Lambda is a function in ruby


For example
-------------

def myproc
p = Proc.new {return "This is proc"}
p.call # here, control leaves
return "Message after calling the proc"
end

def foo
l = lambda {return "This is lambda"}
l.call # here, control doesn't leaves
return "Message after calling lambda"
end

puts myproc

#Output
This is proc


puts foo
#Output
Message after calling lambda
