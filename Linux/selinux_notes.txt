#fedora, #fedora-selinux, #fedora-india

------------------
1)
= Have laptop or VM installed with Fedora 25 Workstation

= Or boot the laptop or VM with Live Fedora Workstation

= Or use any of the Fedora 25 Cloud Base Images to boot VMs

  = Get Fedora 25 Workstation Live ISO images at
https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/download/

  = Get the Fedora 25 Cloud Base Images (raw/Qcow2/vagrant) at
https://alt.fedoraproject.org/cloud/


2)
= Fully update Fedora 25 (dnf update)


3)
= Install these additional packages (dnf install)
  = policycoreutils-python
  = policycoreutils-gui
  = setools
  = selinux-policy-doc
  = rsyslog
------------------

Inside docker container

dnf -y install container-selinux


Deny everything unless explicitly allowed

Fine grained permissions
Ex: Web server is always appending to log file but not editing

Principle's of Selinux :
------------------------
* Mostly closed

* Layers of security or Deny everything
  Innermost is selinux

* Always give least privilege

* MAC Mandatory access control
  Ex: RFID scanner

=> What SELinux can do
- Confine programs to minimun privilege
- Reduced vulnerability to privilege escalation attacks
- Prevent unauthorixed reading and/or modification of data and programs
- Logging of security breaches
- Fine granulated access control implementation
- Role bases Access Control (RBAC)
- MLS/MCS - Multi-Level Security / Multi-Category Security
- ..some more check slides

* Not a complete security solution, but only an element in the Security Infrastruture stack
* .. many more check slides

=> SELinux Architecture
* SELinux Kernal module
* SELinux policy

selinux module is loaded by kernal
Cannot be removed dynamically from kernel (unless you are able to compile kernel)

> ls /etc/selinux

> ls /etc/selinux/targeted

> file /etc/selinux/targeted/policy/policy.30

> cat /etc/selinux/config

> getenforce
# Enforcing

> setenforce 0

> getenforce
# Permissive

> setenforce 1

> getenforce
# Enforcing

> sestatus

whatever is set using setenforce will be gone on reboot.
For ex: say you have selinux enabled and you set setenforce 0 which means you made selinux permissive then on reboot it be again be enforcing which can seen from sestatus.

SELinux modes
- Disabled
- Enabled
  * Permissive
  * Enforcing

  * Access Vector Cache (AVC)
    - caches if something is already checked whether allowed or denied

> avcstat

=> SELinux - Basic Concepts
- Subjects vs Objects
- Labeling
- Type Enforcement (TE)
- SELinux Booleans

> semanage module -l

> systemctl start httpd

> ps -e | grep httpd

> ps -eZ | grep httpd
# To see labels of the process
# Thi is process labels
> ls /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

> ls -Z /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
# Shows label of object
# This is object label

* You can check label using -Z flag

- Every process and object will have label id selinux is enabled.

- Bash process has special label named unconfined_t for which there is a policy which says allow all on all.

> semanage port -l | grep http

> semanage port - (press tab)
ports can be added, deleted etc

* Labeling
- The Security Context format :
  user_identity:role:type:sensitivity:category_level

> seinfo -u

> semanage login -l
Lists logins with SELinux user

> seinfo -r
Lists roles

- user:role:type:level(sensitivity:category)
  system_u:object_r:httpd_config_t:s0

  s0 means sensitivity 0
  1024 categories are available in your system

> id -Z
Current users user:role:type:level(sensitivity:category)

Check fedora guide for table that lists roles
xguest_x has no permissions besides firefox-only for networking
-  Use case : setting up a kiosk

* chcon - to change file security context
  -t option for specifying context type
  --reference to use a reference file's security context rather than

Ex: > chcon -t samba_share_t /var/www/html/index.html
    > ls -Z /var/www/html/index.html
    > wget 192.168.124.1
      Forbidden

If the file is at the default location then you can always restore its label
> restorecon -vR /var/www/html/

> semanage fcontext -l
fcontext means find context lists default labels
Ex: > semanage fcontext -l | grep /var/www

> ls /etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files
Files that have paths and their respective labels stored
These files are not to be edited

> ls -Z /var/www/html/index.html

> mkdir /website
  ls -Z /website
  ls -Zd /website
  #unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0 /website/

  chcon --reference /var/www/ /website/
  ls -Zs /website/
  #system_u:object_r:default_t:s0

  This is a custom location which might break in future if further changes are made or relabeling is done hence, it has to be written in fcontext
  > semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t '/website(/.*)?'
  > restorecon -v /website/

* > systemctl stop httpd
  > /sbin/httpd
  > ps -Ze | grep http
  # type comes as unconfined_t hence processes need not be started like that directly from path
  > killall httpd
  > chcon -t sbin_t /sbin/httpd
  > systemctl start httpd
  > ps -Ze | grep httpd
  # still not correct
  > restorecon -v /sbin/httpd

=> mv is better than cp command in terms of selinux
   tar and rsync has options to restore context when you take backup

=> > sesearch -A
   All allow rules

   > sesearch -A -s httpd_t

=> Setting booleans
   > setsebool <flag_name> on
   setsebool enable_http_homedir on
   setsebool -P enable_http_homedir on
   -P option to persist the flag value after reboot also

=> sVirt for libvert is also available for VM's.
   Means if 1 VM is affected then your host or other VM's are not compromised.
