1) Things should be simple instead of easy

2) Programming is about making computers effective in the world.

3) Make implicit things explicit like for ex:
   wrap a conditional into a meaningful method with proper name so that the purpose of that conditional is clear.
   def good_candidate_for_featuring?
     created_at < 10.days.ago && user.has_confirmed_email?
   end

   To go even further
   def not_too_old?
     created_at < 10.days.ago
   end

   def low_spam_risk?
     user.has_confirmed_email?
   end
