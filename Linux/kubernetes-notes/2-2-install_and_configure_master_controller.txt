Install and configure Master Controller :
-----------------------------------------
All these steps needs to be performed on centos-master

# Distributed key-value store. Etcd is to be run only on master because this is place where all the communication will come for master controller
sudo yum install etcd

cd /etc/kubernetes

sudo vim config

# Change KUBE_MASTER and add KUBE_ETCD_SERVERS
KUBE_MASTER="--master=http://centos-master:8080"

KUBE_ETCD_SERVERS="--etcd-servers=http://centos-master:2379"

cd /etc/etcd

sudo vim etcd.conf
# Replace localhost in ETCD_LISTEN_CLIENT_URLS and ETCD_ADVERTISE_CLIENT_URLS keys to 0.0.0.0

cd /etc/kubernetes
sudo vim apiserver

# Make the following changes in the above file.
KUBE_API_ADDRESS="--address=0.0.0.0"

# Uncomment the lines for KUBE_API_PORT and KUBELET_PORT in the above file.
# Comment out the line for KUBE_ADMISSION_CONTROL since we are not going to apply any restriction for now.

Now start the following services

systemctl enable etcd kube-apiserver kube-controller-manager kube-scheduler

systemctl start etcd kube-apiserver kube-controller-manager kube-scheduler
